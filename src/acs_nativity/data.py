    Retrieve a continuous ACS 1-year nativity time series from 2005–2024.

    This function stitches together ACS table B05002 (used from 2005–2008) and
    ACS table B05012 (used from 2009–2024, excluding 2020 when no 1-year ACS
    was released) into a single, normalized DataFrame. It also adds a derived
    column, "Percent Foreign-born", for convenience.

    Additional keyword arguments are passed directly to
    `censusdis.download_multiyear`, allowing callers to specify geography or
    other censusdis options. Supported geography patterns mirror those in the
    censusdis documentation.

    Args:
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments forwarded to `download_multiyear`, typically
            specifying geography or other censusdis parameters.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with nativity counts for each year, including
        "Total", "Native", "Foreign-born", and the derived
        "Percent Foreign-born".
